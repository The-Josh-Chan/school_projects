This directory is dedicated to all the projects and labs that I've done at Queen's University.

MECH452 - Mechatronics Engineering
In this course, I was introduced to mechatronics engineering, learning about different types of sensors used in robotics and how to choose the right one. The labs included programming a LynxBot to move in certain directions
Lab 1 introduced the lynx bot and allowed us to see how fast the bot could go
Lab 2 introduced a bumper system where I programmed the bot to travel within a box. Each time the lynxbot hit a wall, it would back up then turn left by 90 degrees. This would happen 4 times until it reached its home position
Lab 3 introduced the Sharp infarred sensor which we then programmed the lynxbot to travel the outside of the box. The Sharp sensor was used to gauge the distance away the bot was to the outer wall.

MECH435 - Internal Combustion Engines
This course was all about internal combustion engines. The Lab included receiving engine data which needed to be parsed, cleaned, and modified. Aqcuired data was then used to find the specific engine performances. 
I built the pipeline to get raw data into readable csv files that were then used for data analysis.
