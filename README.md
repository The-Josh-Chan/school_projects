***This directory is dedicated to the interesting the projects and labs that I've done at Queen's University.***

*MECH452 - Mechatronics Engineering*  
In this course, I was introduced to mechatronics engineering. I learned about different types of sensors used in robotics and how to choose the right one. The labs included programming a LynxBot to move in certain directions using an Arduino and C.  
- Lab 1 introduced programming a servo to reflect the position of a potentiometer.  
- Lab 2 introduced the lynx bot. C was used to program the robot to move in one direction and reverse back to the original starting position.   
- Lab 3 introduced a bumper system where I developed code to have to LynxBot travel within a box. Each time the lynxbot hit a wall, it would back up then turn left by 90 degrees. This would happen 4 times until it reached its home position  
- Lab 4 introduced the Sharp infarred sensor which we then programmed the lynxbot to travel the outside of the box. The Sharp sensor was used to gauge the distance bot was to the outer wall. A proportional closed loop feedback control was used to control overshoot of the robots intended distance from the box. 
- Lab 5 introducted a photoresistor to measure light levels from a lamp at specific distances. The photoresistor was then attached to a servo and I developed a program to have the servo pan for a light source then rotate to point to the light source.
- Lab 6 was the final lab that combined everything that we learned about firmware programming together. The objective of the lab was to have the LynxBot scan for a light 2-3 meters away, drive to the light, then neutralize the light by blocking it with a board (Board is attached to the back of the LynxBot). 

*MECH435 - Internal Combustion Engines*  
This course was all about internal combustion engines. The Lab included receiving engine data which needed to be parsed, cleaned, and modified. Aqcuired data was then used to find the specific engine performances.  
- Developed a Python Script to take raw lab data and process to usable readings for data analysis
